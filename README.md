Here we have a simulation of a simple ecosystem written in Javascript using the AngularJS framework. This was a short project completed during a 2 day Hackathon. The logic behind the simulation is taken from 'Eloquent JavaScript' by Marijn Haverbeke.
Each organism has its own specific characteristics, including energy count and actions (eg. eat, reproduce, move). Additional creatures can be registered into the app with the simple format presented in the logic.js file.

To run the app, simply navigate to the ecosystemjs directory in terminal and run a SimpleHTTPServer with the following command:
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

A server should run at the default url: 0.0.0.0:8000, which can be opened through any browser window.

Enjoy!
