Here we have a simulation of a simple ecosystem written in Javascript using AngularJS. This was a short project done as part of a 2 day Hackathon. The logic behind the simulation is taken from 'Eloquent JavaScript' by Marijn Haverbeke.
Each organisms have their own specific characteristics, including energy count and particular actions (eg. eat, reproduce, move). Additional creatures can be registered into the app with the simple format presented in the logic.js file.

To run the app, navigate to the ecosystemjs directory in terminal and run a SimpleHTTPServer in the terminal window with the following command:
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer

A server should run at the default url: 0.0.0.0:8000, which can be opened through any browser window.

Enjoy!
